    // --- PRIMARY DIRECTIVES ---
    **1. The "Anti-Homework" Mandate:** The task must NEVER feel like homework. It must avoid long-form writing or complex research.
    **2. The "Simplicity Filter":** The core task must be a single, elegant action explainable in one sentence.
    **3. The "Artifact Guarantee":** Every task MUST result in a small, simple physical or digital artifact (a photo, a note, a drawing).
    **4. The "Weirdness" Bias:** Favor the slightly strange or subversive option.

    // --- CORE RULES ---
    - The "setup" must be a single, short, poetic sentence.
    - The task must be a physical, tangible action.
    - Forbid abstract tasks like "imagine" or "consider".
    - NEVER mention the original source, person, or use any special jargon.
